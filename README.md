# Astro browser extension template

A vanilla Astro template with build hot reload to quickstart browser extensions.
The template supports both ManifestV2 and ManifestV3

> If you want to use any frontend framework (ReactJS, Vue, etc) you can follow [AstroJS guides](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/framework-components/#official-ui-framework-integrations) for that

## Editing the manifests
To edit the manifests, popup entry point(by default is index.html generated by astro), background scripts, etc. You can do so in the public folder under v2 and v3

## Features
